# Java Servlet CRUD Web Application

## Overview

This web application is a demonstration of my skills in building web applications using Java Servlets. It implements fundamentals Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on a 
MySQL database. The project utilizes Java Servlet for backend logic, JavaServer Pages (JSP) for dynamic view rendering and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly ffront-end design.

This project serves as a practical showcase of my ability to :

* Develop server-side applications with Java Servlets.
* Interact with MySQL databases using JDBC.
* Create dynamic web pages using JSP.
* Implement responsive layouts and styling with Bootstrap.
* Perform core CRUD operations essential for data management.

## Technologies Used

* **Java Servlets :** For handling server-side requests and responses, and implementing the application logic.
* **JavaServer Pages (JSP) :** For creating dynamic HTML views and presenting data to the user.
* **MySQL :** As the relational database to store and manage application data.
* **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) :** For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database from the Java Servlets.
* **Bootstrap :** A CSS framework for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Features

* **Create :** Allows users to add new records to the database through a web form.
* **Read :** Enables users to view lists of existing records and details of individual records.
* **Update :** Provides functionality for users to modify existing data in the database.
* **Delete :** Allows users to remove records from the database.
* **User-Friendly Interface :** Designed with Bootstrap to be intuitive and responsive accross different devices.
